# Week 8: Programming in Python

## Install Python 3

It is helpful for us all to use the same Python environment. We recommend using the all-in-one Python installer [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads.html). We will also be using Python 3 for this class. Anaconda will install most of the packages we will need.

The following install instructions are from the [Data Carpentry lesson on Python](http://www.datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/).

### Windows

* Download and install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads.html)
* Download the default Python 3 installer. Use all of the defaults for installation and **make sure to check "Make Anaconda the default Python"**.

### Mac OS X

* Download and install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads.html)
* Download the default Python 3 installer. Use all of the defaults for installation.

### Linux

1. Download the installer that matches your operating system and save it in your home folder. Download the default Python 3 installer.
2. Open a terminal window.
3. Type
```
bash Anaconda-
```
and then press tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should appear.
4. Press enter. You will follow the text-only prompts. When there is a colon at the bottom of the screen press the down arrow to move down through the text. Type yes and press enter to approve the license. Press enter to approve the default location for the files. Type yes and press enter to prepend Anaconda to your PATH (this makes the Anaconda distribution the default Python).

### Update

After downloading and installing Anaconda, it is helpful to update the packages. Do this in your terminal window.

```
conda update --all
```
