# BCB 546X -- Week 5

## 22 September -- "Chapter 8, Buffalo"

The format for the R part will be different as I'm using the 
Software Carpentry template for the lessons. All the materials 
will be available here: ["R Data Skills"](https://eeob-biodata.github.io/R-Data-Skills). 
The workshop is written in RMarkdown, but its rendering as a 
web site. You may check the R Markdown files at 
[https://github.com/EEOB-BioData/R-Data-Skills/tree/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd](https://github.com/EEOB-BioData/R-Data-Skills/tree/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd).
